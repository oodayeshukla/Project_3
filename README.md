This project looks at the various approaches to investigate various characteristics of assets to build a portfolio. 

The approaches used are: 
(1) Blackman-Litterman approach 
(2) Graph analytics: Neo4j, Pearson Similarity Matrix, Louvain Community Detection 

The presentation shows clustering of assets based only on basic asset metrics, such as Open, Close, Volume, and Marketcap measures.
